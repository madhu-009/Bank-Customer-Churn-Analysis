# Bank Customer Churn Analysis Using Orange Data Mining
Problem Statement:

Customer churn is a significant concern for banks offering credit card services, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, I address a customer churn problem for a hypothetical bank by analyzing credit card customer data to understand customer behavior and engagement patterns. After understanding customer segments and behavior patterns, the next problem is to identify which customers are becoming less engaged and may leave in the near future, so the bank can act early.

Methodology: 

In this project, I have analyze customer churn using a combination of predictive modeling and customer segmentation techniques. I apply multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to identify customers who are likely to churn. Since the dataset is imbalanced, I use recall as the primary evaluation metric to ensure that potential churn customers are accurately identified.

After completing the churn analysis, I use K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behavior. This segmentation helps marketers and decision-makers design targeted and data-driven retention strategies instead of applying uniform actions to all customers. Among all the customers who are about to churn, bank operators should not take the same measures for every single customer. That's because not all customers are of high value. In that sense, bank operators should allocate more resources to retain high-value customers.

Business Implication: 

Keeping an existing customer costs is much less than finding a new one. If the bank can identify and engage customers early, it can reduce revenue loss, lower customer acquistion cost and improve long-term customer value. Even a small reduction in churn can lead to significant revenue savings because retained customers continue to generate income over time.
